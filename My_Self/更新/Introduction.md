Hi, first of all, thank you XXX and XXX so much for taking the time to interview me. I'm Ray, and I graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in Mathematics, along with a minor in Computer Science. After graduation, I started working as an Azure Support Engineer, 
and I’m part of a team that focuses on Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, and Azure Migration services.

In my role, I provide technical support and help troubleshoot issues for enterprise and premium customers using Azure to manage their backup, disaster recovery, and migration needs. My goal is to ensure their environments run smoothly by addressing any issues and helping 
them optimize how they use not onbly these essential services that our team is focus on, but also those Azure services like Azure Virtual Machine, Azure Virtual Network, Azure Storage etc(et cetera).

Also, working with customers in this role has really helped me improve my communication skills. Beyond just solving technical problems, I’ve become really good at understanding the customer’s core needs and approaching solutions from their perspective.
