Hi, first of all, thank you XXX and XXX so much for taking the time to interview me. I'm Ray, and I graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in Mathematics, along with a minor in Computer Science. After graduation, I started working as an Azure Support Engineer, 
and I’m part of a team that focuses on Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, and Azure Migration services.

In my role, I provide technical support and help troubleshoot issues for enterprise and premium customers using Azure to manage their backup, disaster recovery, and migration needs. My goal is to ensure their environments run smoothly by addressing any issues and helping 
them optimize how they use not onbly these essential services that our team is focus on, but also those Azure services like Azure Virtual Machine, Azure Virtual Network, Azure Storage etc(et cetera).

Also, working with customers in this role has really helped me improve my communication skills. Beyond just solving technical problems, I’ve become really good at understanding the customer’s core needs and approaching solutions from their perspective.

你好！首先，非常感谢 XXX 和 XXX 抽出时间面试我。
我叫 Ray，毕业于弗吉尼亚理工大学（Virginia Tech），主修数学，辅修计算机科学。毕业后，我加入微软 Azure 担任支持工程师，所在团队专注于 Azure Backup、Azure Site Recovery 以及 Azure Migration 等服务。

在目前的岗位中，我为使用 Azure 进行备份、灾难恢复和迁移的企业级与高级客户提供技术支持与故障排查。我的目标是通过及时解决问题，并帮助客户优化这些关键服务的使用（不仅包括我们团队所负责的服务，也包括 Azure Virtual Machines、Azure Virtual Network、Azure Storage 等其他 Azure 服务），以确保其环境稳定顺畅地运行。

此外，这份工作中与客户的持续合作也显著提升了我的沟通能力。我不仅关注技术问题本身，更善于理解客户的核心诉求，并从客户的视角出发制定与推进解决方案。
